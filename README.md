# Animal shelter site

# Description 

This project is an Animal Shelter Site. Users can donate via paypal or credit cards. They can browse pets that are up for adoption and fill up adoption interest form. Also, there is a shop, where users can add to cart.

Some of the challenges I faced were implementing paypal and having separate images per card (which is still a task todo).
