				<h1>FAQs</h1>

				<br />
				<h6>1) What is Kipu's Rescue?</h6>
				<p>
					Kipu's Rescue is a nonprofit organization that finds homes for
					abandoned cats and dogs throughout the Tri-State area, and provides
					behavior intervention when needed to improve chances of adoption.
					Founded in 1967, we operate an animal shelter in Manhattan. We also
					provide programs that enhance the bond between animals and people.
					Kipu's Rescue is a 501(c)3 organization.
				</p>

				<h6>2) Where is Kipu's Rescue located?</h6>
				<p>
					We are located at 200 East Blue Street at the corner of Red Line
					Street.
				</p>

				<h6>3) What are the closest subways?</h6>
				<p>
					The closest subway lines are the N, Q, R, W, J, Z, or 6 to CANAL. You
					may also take the B, D to GRAND Street or the F, M to
					Broadway-Lafayette.
				</p>

				<h6>4) What are your hours?</h6>
				<p>
					Kipu's Rescue visiting hours are by <b>appointment only</b>. We ask
					that potential adopters have an idea of what they are looking to adopt
					prior to making an appointment in order to streamline visits. Please
					check out our
					<a href='/adopt/#adopt'>
						<strong>
							<em> adoptable animals</em>
						</strong>
					</a>{' '}
					and then{' '}
					<a href='/adopt/adoptionInterestForm'>
						{' '}
						<strong>
							<em> submit an adoption inquiry</em>
						</strong>
					</a>{' '}
					to make an appointment to visit our animals. Appointments are
					available between Tuesday-Fridays.
				</p>

				<h6>5) What is your adoption process?</h6>
				<p>
					When you see an animal on our website that you like, you should submit
					an inquiry to get the process started. You will then be connected with
					an adoptions counselor who can tell you more about the animal or
					schedule an appointment to come meet them! In general, you’ll fill out
					our adoption application after meeting with the animal at our
					facility. We ask for a personal reference (this can be a family
					member, friend, employer) who can attest to your ability to care for a
					pet. For dog adopters, we ask for your building information to make
					sure you are allowed to have dogs in your apartment. This information
					can be in the form of a lease, phone number of a leasing office,
					landlord, super, or property website. If you currently have or
					previously had a pet, we ask for your vet’s information.
					<br />
					If you are looking to adopt a dog, we ask that all members of the
					household be present to meet the dog (or will be able to come down to
					meet the dog at some point). This includes other dogs in the
					household. We want the dogs’ first meeting to be in the safety of the
					shelter with our staff present.
					<br />
					Some cat adoptions can be processed same-day. Dogs may take a few
					days.
					<br />
					Adopters must provide proof of vaccination or wear a mask while at our
					facility.
				</p>

					<ul>
						<li>$175 per cat</li>
						<li>
							$200 per kitten or $300 per pair (Why Two Kittens Are Better Than

						<li>$395 per dog under 1 year (includes collar and leash)</li>

					(bottle-baby) kittens. Our fosters are recruited from within our
					shelter volunteers. If you’re interested in fostering for Kipu's

				<h6>10) Do you take donations of pet supplies?</h6>
				<p>
					Yes, we can accept certain pet supplies. We’re able to accept wet
					dog/cat food, wee-wee pads, linens (towels, sheets, blankets are great
					– please no pillows, dog beds, or comforters), new dog/cat toys, and
					unopened dog/cat treats. We’re currently unable to accept opened dry
					food, leashes, harnesses, collars, cat litter/litter boxes,
					medication, animal clothing, used toys, food bowls. Please{' '}

						<strong> contact Us</strong>
					</a>{' '}
					to set-up an appointment to drop of donations; we are not accepting
					walk-in donations at this time.
				</p>

				<h6>11) Is Kipu's Rescue a “no-kill” shelter?</h6>
				<p>
					Kipu's Rescue will never euthanize for space or time. Adoptable
					animals will stay in our care for as long as it takes to get them
					adopted or placed in a more suitable rescue or foster situation.
				</p>

				<h6>12) Can I bring students to Kipu's Rescue for a school trip?</h6>
				<p>
					Due to the fact that we are such a small shelter with limited time and
					resources, we cannot accommodate school group visits.
				</p>

				<h6>13) I found a dog. Can you help me find the owner?</h6>
				<p>
					Yes, please call us at 877-393-4448. We will arrange a time for you to
					bring the dog into Kipu's Rescue during business hours and we can scan
					for a microchip.{' '}
